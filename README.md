# cassandracluster
### This repository is for setting up a cassandra cluster on linux machines. 

Apache Cassandra, an Apache Software Foundation project, is a massively scalable NoSQL distributed database management system. Cassandra is designed to handle big data workloads across multiple data centers with no single point of failure, providing enterprises with extremely high database performance and availability. The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data.

Cassandra's support for replicating across multiple data-centers is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages. With that being said, let's dive straight into the configuration and setup of our cluster with cassandra.
